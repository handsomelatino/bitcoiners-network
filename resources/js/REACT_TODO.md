### TODO

- Deal with numeral phrases ie: "1 day", "2 days"
- React Redux to cache most data as it is unlikely to change
- After React Redux -> calculate combined values of followers + following
- Deal with twitter profiles where the image doesn't load
- When image doesn't load, cache (save) the value on a cookie so that it doesn't tell the BE again

### LAST PR
- Logout route
- Social icons links
- Get Started Page
- Check `firstLogin=1` to show popup to not bitcoiners
- **Vote Tooltip Component**: Check for close vote tip on current user + API call
- Terms page
- Privacy Policy
- USER NOT FOUND (ie: http://localhost:2121/u/profile/handsome_latino)
- Use Clown face for Nocoiner -> adjusted all badges to make the icons slightly bigger
- Landing Page finishing touches + animation
- description + og:image
- skeleton loader and split loading for dashboard and user profiles for more seamless UX
